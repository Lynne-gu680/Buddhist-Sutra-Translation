1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,200\nToday, we will teach "The Sūtra of Great Liberation."\n今天我们讲《圣大解脱经》\n\n2\n00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,400\nAfter we finish teaching this week,\n这个礼拜讲过了以后\n\n3\n00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,840\nI won't have classes here for about a month.\n暂时一个月左右 我这边没有课\n\n4\n00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,280\nI temporarily won't have classes here.\n我这边暂时没有课\n\n5\n00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,160\nWhether I am at the institute\n不管是我在学院也好\n\n6\n00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,560\nor elsewhere, throughout this year,\n在外面也好 凡是今年\n\n7\n00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:44,200\nI will not be receiving or meeting with people.\n都我不接见 接待\n\n8\n00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,600\nIn this regard, I may not be able to fulfill everyone's wishes.\n这一点 不能满足大家的愿\n\n9\n00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,080\nBecause since the pandemic began until now,\n因为从疫情开始到现在\n\n10\n00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,600\nthis has also been the case within the institute.\n学院内部也是这样的\n\n11\n00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,560\nIt will continue to be so for some time in the future.\n以后一段时间当中也是如此\n\n12\n00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,160\nThe classes here,\n我们这边的课\n\n13\n00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,200\ntaught by all the khenpos and khenmos, are all the same.\n其他各个堪布 堪姆都是一样的\n\n14\n00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,560\nThere is no difference.\n没有什么差别\n\n15\n00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,800\nEveryone should study and reflect well.\n大家应该很好地去闻思\n\n16\n00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,920\nLet me just mention this timing briefly,\n这个时间稍微跟大家说一下\n\n17\n00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,200\nas it may be helpful.\n可能好一点\n\n18\n00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:29,240\nNext, we will continue teaching "The Sūtra of Great Liberation."\n接下来我们讲《圣大解脱经》\n\n19\n00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,800\nIn the first volume, we previously covered\n在第一卷当中 我们前面讲到\n\n20\n00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:39,800\nprostrations to the buddhas of the past and prostrations to the buddhas of the present.\n顶礼过去佛 顶礼现在佛\n\n21\n00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:46,800\nNow we will teach prostrations to the buddhas of the future: I prostrate to the future buddhas.\n现在讲顶礼未来佛 南无未来佛\n\n22\n00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,800\nAs we mentioned before, there are not that many—\n那天前面也讲过 不是特别多\n\n23\n00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,440\napproximately forty-one buddhas.\n大概有四十一尊佛\n\n24\n00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,160\nHowever, these buddhas appear in different sūtras,\n但是这些佛在不同的经典当中\n\n25\n00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,720\nand their names are not particularly easy to distinguish.\n名号不是特别好分\n\n26\n00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,720\nSometimes among the present buddhas,\n有时候在现在佛当中\n\n27\n00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,280\nthere are quite similar ones—\n也有比较相同的\n\n28\n00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,400\nnames of past buddhas or names of future buddhas.\n过去佛的名字 或者未来佛的名字\n\n29\n00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,640\nAmong the names of future buddhas,\n未来佛的名字当中\n\n30\n00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,520\nthere are also some that seem to be present buddhas—like that.\n也有好像是现在佛 有那样的\n\n31\n00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,320\nBut in any case,\n但不管怎么样\n\n32\n00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,800\nthese buddha names are particularly numerous.\n这些佛号有特别多的\n\n33\n00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,600\nThe specific buddhas they refer to\n具体他们所指的佛陀\n\n34\n00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,800\nare all buddhas of the future, past, and present.\n都是有未来 过去 现在的佛\n\n35\n00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,640\nSo why do we gain merit by prostrating to future buddhas?\n所以我们对未来佛顶礼的话 为什么得功德呢\n\n36\n00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,240\nActually, this is a kind of interdependence.\n其实这是一种缘起\n\n37\n00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,240\nIn our Avataṃsaka Sūtra,\n我们《华严经》当中\n\n38\n00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,680\nall the virtue created in the future, present, and past—\n未来 现在 过去\n\n39\n00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,800\nthe virtue created in the three times—\n三世所造的一切善根\n\n40\n00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,920\ncan be dedicated to all sentient beings; there is such teaching.\n回向给一切众生 也有这样的\n\n41\n00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,640\nSo the virtue of the future\n所以未来的善根\n\n42\n00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,000\ncan also be dedicated now.\n现在也可以回向\n\n43\n00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,240\nIn this regard, even in the Lesser Vehicle,\n这一点 像小乘当中\n\n44\n00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:04,520\nthey also teach that future dharmas\n也是讲未来的法\n\n45\n00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,920\nall have what we could call a "continuum of attainment."\n现在都是有一些得绳\n\n46\n00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,320\nWe can say there is a kind of continuum of attainment.\n可以这么讲 有一种得绳\n\n47\n00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,600\nIn this way, dedication is also possible.\n以这种方式来回向也可以\n\n48\n00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:18,120\nOr we can dedicate the merit of these future buddhas\n或者我们未来的这些佛的功德\n\n49\n00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,040\nnow in a mentally created way—\n现在用意幻的方���来\n\n50\n00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,880\nmaking offerings to and prostrating to future buddhas is also possible.\n供养未来佛 顶礼未来佛也是可以\n\n51\n00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,520\nIn this regard, just as I explained in the previous session,\n这一点 就像我上一节课讲的一样\n\n52\n00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,400\nperhaps for us as ordinary beings,\n可能我们作为凡夫人\n\n53\n00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,280\nour mode of thinking tends to be unidirectional.\n我们的思维模式应该是单向的\n\n54\n00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,240\nWe can recall the past.\n我们能回忆过去的\n\n55\n00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,520\nThe present moment—I can basically remember it.\n当下 我基本上能想得起来\n\n56\n00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,560\nAs for the future,\n未来的话\n\n57\n00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,520\nfor us it is also a vague feeling.\n对我们来讲 也是一个模糊的感觉\n\n58\n00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,240\nBut actually, regarding the future—\n但实际上对未来\n\n59\n00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,720\nthese things that have no obstruction of time and space,\n没有时空阻碍的这些\n\n60\n00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,480\nwhether it be virtue\n不管是善根也好\n\n61\n00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,960\nor unconditioned virtuous dharmas—\n无为法的善法也好\n\n62\n00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,520\nfrom this perspective, this is also reasonable.\n在这个层面来讲 这也是合理的\n\n63\n00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,440\nBecause our conceptual thinking\n因为我们的分别念\n\n64\n00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:15,760\ncan only exist at the level of ordinary beings.\n只能在凡夫的这种位置上\n\n65\n00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,160\nAt that time, for us,\n这个时候 对我们而言\n\n66\n00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,160\nthere are certainly some difficulties.\n肯定有一定的困难\n\n67\n00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,240\nToday, we will continue teaching the infinite buddhas of the future excellent eon\n今天我们继续讲《圣大解脱经》当中的 未来贤劫无量佛\n\n68\n00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,560\nin "The Sūtra of Great Liberation."\n南无未来贤劫无量诸佛\n\n69\n00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,120\nHere, the infinite buddhas of the future excellent eon—\n他这里 未来贤劫无量佛\n\n70\n00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,640\nregarding the future,\n未来的话\n\n71\n00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,480\nthey are also the buddhas of our excellent eon.\n也是我们贤劫当中的佛\n\n72\n00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,960\nAlso, the future eons—\n还有未来的这些劫\n\n73\n00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,600\nthey can all be called by the excellent and wondrous name as well.\n都用贤妙的名称来称呼也可以\n\n74\n00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,840\nWhether it's the future excellent eon\n未来的贤劫也好\n\n75\n00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,280\nor future eons, there are also infinite buddhas.\n未来的劫当中 也有无量的佛\n\n76\n00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,280\nWe should prostrate to these buddhas.\n要顶礼这些佛\n\n77\n00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,000\nFirst, it says: I prostrate to Maitreya Buddha.\n首先讲 南无弥勒佛\n\n78\n00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,400\nAs everyone knows,\n弥勒佛的话 大家知道\n\n79\n00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,280\nMaitreya Buddha is currently Maitreya Bodhisattva.\n现在的弥勒菩萨\n\n80\n00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,120\nSome sūtras teach\n有些经典当中讲\n\n81\n00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,280\nthat when human lifespan reaches eighty thousand years,\n人寿八万岁的时候\n\n82\n00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:12,840\nMaitreya Bodhisattva will become a buddha and guide sentient beings.\n弥勒菩萨成佛 度化众生\n\n83\n00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,000\nAt that time, just as Śākyamuni Buddha\n那个时候 就像释迦牟尼佛\n\n84\n00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,960\nturned the wheel of Dharma three times under the Bodhi tree,\n在菩提树下三转法轮一样\n\n85\n00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,840\nthere will be the three assemblies under the Nāga Tree.\n有龙华三会 龙华三会的佛\n\n86\n00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,000\nThe first assembly, the second assembly, and the third assembly—\n第一会 第二会 第三会\n\n87\n00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,320\neach will be different, as we have explained before.\n都有不同的 我们以前也讲过\n\n88\n00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,840\nEach time, more than nine billion sentient beings will be liberated.\n每一次有九十多亿的众生度化\n\n89\n00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,520\nThe first assembly will be 9.6 billion,\n第一会是九十六亿\n\n90\n00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,840\nthe second assembly 9.4 billion,\n第二会的时候 九十四亿\n\n91\n00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,080\nand the third assembly 9.2 billion—\n第三会的时候 九十二亿\n\n92\n00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,600\nso many sentient beings will be guided to liberation.\n这么多的众生度化\n\n93\n00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,080\nThere is a sūtra called the "Guǎngpǔ Sūtra."\n有一个经典叫做《广普经》\n\n94\n00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,120\nIn the "Guǎngpǔ Sūtra," it teaches\n《广普经》当中讲\n\n95\n00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,480\nthat if we now, under Śākyamuni Buddha's teachings,\n我们现在在释迦牟尼佛的教法下面\n\n96\n00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,120\nengage in virtuous actions—\n如果行持善法\n\n97\n00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:05,200\neven if we just recite "Namo Buddhāya,"\n哪怕是行持"南无佛"这样的称呼\n\n98\n00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,960\nwe can attain liberation during the third assembly.\n也是第三会的时候可以得解脱的\n\n99\n00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,880\nIf we take the three refuges,\n如果我们受三皈依戒\n\n100\n00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,800\nthen we will attain liberation during the second assembly.\n那么第二会的时候得到解脱\n\n101\n00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,080\nIf we take the five precepts or monastic ordination,\n如果我们受五戒或者出家戒\n\n102\n00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,120\nwe will attain liberation in the first assembly.\n第一会就获得解脱\n\n103\n00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:28,960\nSo from now on, we should wholeheartedly\n所以我们从现在开始尽心尽力地\n\n104\n00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,720\nengage in virtuous actions under the Buddha's teachings—at the very least.\n至少也是在佛的教法下行持善法\n\n105\n00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,920\nEven if someone recites "Namo Buddhāya,"\n哪怕是别人念"南无佛"\n\n106\n00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,840\n"Namo Amitābha,"\n"南无阿弥陀佛"\n\n107\n00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,240\n"Namo Śākyamuni Buddha"—\n"南无释迦牟尼佛"\n\n108\n00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,080\nthe significance of this is also extremely vast.\n这样的意义也是非常广大的\n\n109\n00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,520\nSo we should not,\n所以我们不能\n\n110\n00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,040\njust because something seems like an insignificant virtue,\n因为只是一个很微不足道的善根\n\n111\n00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,960\nabandon it or look down on it—we cannot do that.\n而放弃 歧视 不能这样的\n\n112\n00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,440\nRather, we should wholeheartedly engage in any virtuous action,\n应该哪怕是任何一个善法 尽心尽力地行持\n\n113\n00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,360\nno matter how small.\n如果我们行持慈悲心\n\n114\n00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,240\nIf we cultivate loving-kindness,\n更广大 他的功德\n\n115\n00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,280\nits merit is even more vast,\n因为弥勒 他叫慈氏"宣巴"\n\n116\n00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,400\nbecause Maitreya means "Loving One"—"Jampa."\n这样的话 修慈心的功德\n\n117\n00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,960\nSo the merit of cultivating loving-kindness\n更对他有相应的缘起\n\n118\n00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,480\nhas a corresponding connection with him.\n就像《大集经》当中说也是过\n\n119\n00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,480\nAs it is also said in the "Mahāsaṃnipāta Sūtra":\n若有修集大慈心 具足成满十善法\n\n120\n00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:36,240\n"If one cultivates great loving-kindness and perfects the ten virtues, that person will definitely see Maitreya Buddha. Therefore, bodhicitta is inconceivable."\n是人定见弥勒佛 故菩提心难思议\n\n121\n00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,400\nSo if we cultivate great loving-kindness and great compassion,\n所以如果我们修大慈大悲心\n\n122\n00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,360\nand in this circumstance, begin to practice the ten virtues,\n在这种情况下 开始修十善法\n\n123\n00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,000\nthen this person will definitely\n那么这个人 将来一定能\n\n124\n00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,320\npersonally meet Maitreya Buddha in the future.\n亲自见到弥勒佛\n\n125\n00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:59,240\nSo now, when we cultivate bodhicitta and loving-kindness,\n所以我们现在修菩提心 慈悲心\n\n126\n00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,120\nthis power is extremely, extremely strong.\n这个力量非常非常强大\n\n127\n00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,200\nIt may seem to us that cultivating loving-kindness\n我们看起来 好像修一个慈心\n\n128\n00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,120\nis a very simple matter.\n这个都是很简单的事情\n\n129\n00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,880\nBut the fruition it brings\n但是它带来的这种果\n\n130\n00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,440\nis truly inconceivable.\n确实也是不可思议的\n\n131\n00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:21,520\nIf we establish a virtuous connection with the future Maitreya Buddha,\n我们与未来的弥勒佛结上善缘的话\n\n132\n00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,840\nwhen we later teach about Maitreya Bodhisattva,\n到时候我们讲弥勒菩萨的时候\n\n133\n00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,400\nwe can also give everyone a brief introduction.\n也可以给大家简单介绍\n\n134\n00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:37,840\nNext, it says: I prostrate to Pure Body Buddha.\n接下来他这里讲 南无净身佛\n\n135\n00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,440\nIn the Lotus Sūtra, there is a bodhisattva named Store of Virtue.\n《法华经》当中有一个德藏菩萨\n\n136\n00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:49,320\nThis Store of Virtue Bodhisattva will in the future become Pure Body Buddha.\n这个德藏菩萨 将来变成净身佛\n\n137\n00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,920\nThen: I prostrate to Flower Light Buddha.\n然后南无华光佛\n\n138\n00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,720\nThis is also mentioned in the Lotus Sūtra.\n也是《妙法莲华经》当中提过\n\n139\n00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:04,400\nEveryone should remember that in the Lotus Sūtra,\n大家都记着《妙法莲华经》里面\n\n140\n00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,280\nthere are the Buddha's five hundred disciples\n有很多的 佛的五百个弟子\n\n141\n00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:17,680\nand many others, including Devadatta and so forth,\n还有许多的 包括提婆达多等等\n\n142\n00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,680\nwho all receive prophecies of what buddha they will become in the
